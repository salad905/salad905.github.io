                <h3>Fake News Detector</h3>
                <ul>
                    This was a project I worked on for my Data Mining class. All details can be found in our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EK490I5k3OPS1GW0fnBfoLVexApzETaZ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">paper</a>.<br>
                    Summary:
                    <h4>1. Abstract</h4>
                    Misinformation is an ever-lasting relevant issue. To combat this, we aimed to classify news articles as real or fake using natural language processing and machine learning. It focuses on detecting fabricated content based on textual patterns, aiming to support digital literacy and trust in online information.
                    <h4>2. Methodologies</h4>
                    Found a Kaggle dataset with about 40k articles. Preprocessing steps included tokenization, lemmatization, and feature extraction using Bag of Words and TF-IDF. Several classifiers were tested, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, with model performance evaluated through metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. A <a href="https://salad905-fake-news-detector.hf.space/?__theme=system&deep_link=hF7hJs8eL14" target="_blank">Gradio interface</a> was created for interactive predictions based on user-inputted text.
                    <h4>3. Reflection</h4>
                    The lines between "fake" and "real" are ambiguous. As much as this project helped familiarize me with NLP tasks, exploratory data analysis, building a front-end interface, and so on, I found that this project is not the most practical.

                <h3>Deepfake Generation & Detection</h3><ul>
                    This is my 2025 Summer Project.
                    Summary:
                    <h4>1. Abstract</h4>
                    This project addresses the growing threat of deepfake videos by building a machine learning pipeline to detect manipulated facial content. It targets the classification of real vs. fake images, contributing to media authentication efforts.
                    <h4>2. Methodologies</h4>
                    Removed background using BiRefNet. Face detection and cropping were performed using MTCNN and facenet-pytorch. Embeddings from a pre-trained FaceNet model were extracted and used to train a classifier. Evaluation included accuracy, confusion matrices, ROC-AUC, and visual inspection of misclassified samples. Currently has a running <a href="https://salad905-space2.hf.space/?__theme=system&deep_link=hVptdHSzaXo" target="_blank">Gradio interface</a>, planning to expand to a Chrome extension.
                    <h4>3. Reflection</h4>
                    Deepfake images are reaching an eery realness. AI will eventually get to the point of complete indistinguishability from real images to the average human eye. I am aware that I can't shoot for anything groundbreaking with this project, but I at the very least hoped for promotion of media literacy and a sense of caution when approaching faces on the Internet.

                    This was my Winter 2024 Collaborative Research Project. We worked in 4 pairs, each pair tackling a different question. Mine was "Can we come up with a better-performing topology?". The answer is no. But the process is what mattered! We learned how to conduct a proper literature review, learned to brainstorm and propose compelling/plausible research questions, and learned to make a research poster. We presented at Horizons, which is a Knox College on-campus research symposium. Here is our poster:<br>
